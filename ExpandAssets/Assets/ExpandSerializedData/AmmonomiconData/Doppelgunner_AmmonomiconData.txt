Yet, orbs and lights, stars and shades: all were without consciousness, without purpose nor aim.\n\nIt jumped, from reflection to reflection, from pond to pond, then from pond to the looking-glass. There, much did it find to copy: Gungeoneers, striken with purpose, of shapes unchanging, of body and history to hold fast and have forever.\n\nAnd soon it was that the Doppelgunner realized... it wanted to be a reflection no more."
